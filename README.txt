# Pictorials
Pictorials is a PHP and JavaScript based gallery application designed to be
simple to set up and run. It is designed in such a way that you do not need to
change where your photos are currently stored, and does not require any use of
web server rewrites. It is secured by HTTP basic authentication, and protects
against hotlinking of images by allowing you to store your files outside of
the web root.

## Browsers
This project is targeting the latest versions of Firefox, Pale Moon and Chrome.
It may work in IE11, and probably works in Edge, but I don't particularly care
about it or Safari.

This project started mainly as a stateless file viewer, not a gallery. Now it
it is a powerful photo album application including a true gallery view.
