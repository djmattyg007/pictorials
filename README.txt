Pictorials

Pictorials is a PHP and JavaScript based gallery application designed to be
simple to set up and run. It is designed in such a way that you do not need to
change where your photos are currently stored, and does not require any use of
web server rewrites. It is secured by HTTP basic authentication, and protects
against hotlinking of images by allowing you to store your files outside of
the web root.

This project is targeting the latest versions of Firefox, Pale Moon and Chrome.
It may work in IE10-11, and probably works in Edge, but I don't particularly
care about it or Safari.

There are several features that are planned, but for which there is no code
right now. Chief among these is a traditional gallery view. This project
started mainly as a file viewer (not a gallery), hence the current appearance.
Contributions are welcome - feel free to submit an issue or pull request.
