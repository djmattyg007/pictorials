Pictorials

Pictorials is a PHP and JavaScript based gallery application designed to be
simple to set up and run. It is designed in such a way that you do not need to
where your photos are currently stored, and does not require any use of web
server rewrites. It is secured by HTTP basic authentication, and protects
against hotlinking of images by allowing you to store your files outside of
the web root.

While this project is fully functional, it is not yet feature complete. Things
are subject to change.


Except where noted otherwise, this software is released into the public domain
