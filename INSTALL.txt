Installation Guide

1. Upload your photos onto your computer. The webserver must be able to access
   them. They should not be inside the webroot.

2. Download the Pictorials codebase onto your server, somewhere outside the
   webroot. You can do this by cloning the git repository or by downloading the
   tarball provided by Github.

3. Run 'composer install' in the root folder of the Pictorials codebase. You'll
   need to install composer to do this. You can obtain composer from the
   website https://getcomposer.org

4. Create two empty directories somewhere outside the webroot, and ensure they
   are writeable by the webserver. One of these folders will hold the
   application's cache, and the other will hold the log files. Putting them
   inside the Pictorials codebase directory is fine. If you intend to disable
   logging, you can forego creating a 2nd directory.

5. Run the Pictorials installer with the following command:
   php entry/install.php
   You will need to supply various flags. These are all detailed in
   installer.txt in the documentation.

6. Create a User account to access the web interface by running the following
   command:
   php cli/user.php create name username password
   For more information about managing Users, look at user_management.txt in
   the documentation. For more broad information on access control, look at
   accesscontrol_overview.txt.

7. Add your first Path! Albums are represented as Paths in Pictorials:
   php cli/path.php create name fullpath
   For more information about managing Paths, look at path_management.txt in
   the documentation. For general information about Paths, look at
   paths_overview.txt.

8. Give your User account access to your first Path:
   php cli/path.php allow --user --add path_id username

9. If you told the installer to automatically create the webroot files for you,
   you're done! If not, now is when you need to create those files. First,
   create a PHP file (at the path specified for the --script-baseurl flag) with
   the following contents:

     <?php
     define("BASE_PATH", "/path/to/pictorials/installation/"); // Must have a trailing slash
     require(BASE_PATH . "entry/web.php");

   If you passed the --php-static-assets flag, create a PHP file (at the path
   specified for the --asset-baseurl flag) with the following contents:

     <?php
     define("BASE_PATH", "/path/to/pictorials/installation/"); // Must have a trailing slash
     require(BASE_PATH . "entry/static.php");

   If you did not pass the --php-static-assets flag, create a symlink (at the
   path specified for the --asset-baseurl flag) like so:

     ln -s /path/to/pictorials/installation/assets /pictorials/

That's it! You should now have a fully functioning image gallery. Point your
web browser to the PHP file specified for the --script-baseurl flag, login with
the User account you created in Step 6, and browse to one of the paths you
configured in Step 7.
