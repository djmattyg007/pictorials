Installation Guide

1. Upload your photos onto your computer. The webserver must be able to access
   them.

2. Download the Pictorials codebase onto your server, somewhere outside the
   webroot. You can do this by cloning the git repository or by downloading the
   tarball provided by Github.

3. Run 'composer install' in the root folder of the Pictorials codebase. You'll
   need to install composer to do this - there's a link below.

4. Create an empty directory somewhere outside the webroot, and ensure it is
   writeable by the webserver. This folder will hold the application's cache.
   Inside the Pictorials codebase is fine.

5. In the conf directory, make a copy of auth.json.example, naming it auth.json.
   In here, you'll define all the different accounts that can access your gallery.
   Some things to note:
    - You can have as many users as you want.
    - Each user must have a password.
    - Each user can be placed in as many groups as you want.
    - You should remove all of the default users and groups before adding your own.

6. Also in the conf directory, make a copy of paths.json.example, naming it
   paths.json. This is where you tell the Pictorials software about all of the
   photos you uploaded in Step 1.
    - You can have as many paths as you want.
    - A "path" is essentially an album.
    - Almost all images (with a few exceptions) inside this path and all of its
      subfolders will be browseable from within the webpage.
    - For details on how the privacy controls work, consult this link:
      https://github.com/djmattyg007/fb-privacy-auth/blob/1.0.1/README.txt
    - The path to each folder should be an absolute path, not relative.
    - By default, Pictorials will not follow symlinks. If you wish to enable this
      behaviour, add "symlinks" to the permissions array on a path by path basis.
    - Pictorials will hide all folders named "NSFW". If you wish to disable this
      behaviour, add "nsfw" to the permissions array on a path by path basis.

8. Somewhere inside the webroot, create a PHP file (it can be named whatever you want)
   with the following contents:
   <?php
   define("BASE_PATH", "/path/to/pictorials/installation/"); // Must have a trailing slash
   require(BASE_PATH . "main.php");

9. Create a symlink somewhere inside the webroot (alongside the PHP file you just
   created is fine) to the assets directory in the Pictorials codebase.

10.Again in the conf directory, make a copy of app.json.example, naming it
   app.json. This is where general application configuration is contained.
   a) APP_NAME: You can change to anything else if you wish. It's used in the
      headings of the site.
   b) CACHE_DIR: The absolute path to the caching directory you created in Step 4.
   c) ASSET_BASE_URL: The base used when generating URLs to assets. This must
      reflect where you created the symlink to the assets directory in Step 9,
      and it must have a trailing slash.
   d) SCRIPT_BASE_URL: The path to the PHP file you created in Step 8.
   You can add "gif" to the list of allowed image types if you wish, but it's
   excluded by default.

That's it! You should now have a fully functioning image gallery. Point your
web browser to the PHP file you created in Step 8, login with one of the accounts
you created in Step 5, and browse one of the paths you configured in Step 6.
