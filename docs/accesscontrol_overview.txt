Pictorials has two core concepts with regards to user management: Users and
Groups. Anyone you wish to give access to your Pictorials web interface must
have a User account with an associated password. Groups are used for the sole
purpose of simplifying access control management through the privacy control
system (see the following URL for an overview of how access control works:
https://github.com/djmattyg007/fb-privacy-auth/blob/1.0.1/README.txt).
Therefore, a User does not have to be a member of any Groups. Finally, there is
no signup form through the web interface. It is protected by basic
authentication, and all Users are managed by the administrator through a CLI
interface.
