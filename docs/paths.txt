Pictorials models each album as a "path" within the software. Each path has
its own set of permissions and privacy controls. This is a useful abstraction
because it means you can include the same path twice but employ different
privacy controls for different users/groups.

Some broad notes about paths:
- You can have as many paths as you want
- Almost all images (with a few exceptions) inside a path and all of its
  subfolders will be browseable from within the web interface.
- The path to each folder must be an absolute path, not relative.
- Each path can have its own set of permissions that enable various bits of
  functionality. For an explanation of what each of these are, consult
  permissions.txt in the documentation.
- For details on how the privacy controls work, consult this link:
