Guide for managing Users
All User accounts are managed through a CLI interface. This is a guide on the
various commands available for administrators. All examples assume your current
working directory is the base Pictorials path.

Create
Run: php cli/user.php create [name [username [password]]]

The three arguments must be passed in order. If you omit one or more of them,
you will be greeted with an interactive prompt to enter the remaining details.

Delete
Run: php cli/user.php delete [username]

Use this to delete a single user. If you omit the username, you will be greeted
with an interactive prompt to enter the username.

View
Run: php cli/user.php view [username]

This presents you with the User's name, and a list of any Groups they are a
member of. If you omit the username, you will be greeted with an interactive
prompt to enter the username.

List
Run: php cli/user.php list [--sort[=(username|name)]]

Displays the full list of Users in the system, optionally sorted. Pass
--sort=username to sort the list by username. Pass --sort=name to sort by
names. Passing --sort with no value defaults to sorting by username.

Update
Run: php cli/user.php update [username [name]]

Use this to update a user's name. If you omit any of the arguments, you will be
greeted with an interactive prompt to enter the remaining details.
