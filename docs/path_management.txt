Guide for managing Paths
All Paths are managed through CLI interface. This is a guide on the various
commands available for administrators. All examples assume your current working
directory is the base Pictorials path.

Create
Run: php entry/path.php create [--sortorder=<number>] [name [path]]

The two non-optional arguments must be passed in order. If you omit one or more
of them, you will be greeted with an interactive prompt to enter the remaining
details.
The --sortorder flag must be passed a positive integer that is greaterthan
zero. The sort order affects the order of albums presented to the end user in
the web interface.

List
Run: php entry/path.php list [--sort[=(sortorder|name)]]

Displays the full list of Paths in the system, optionally sorted. Pass
--sort=sortorder to sort the list by the sort order values specified in the
database. Pass --sort=name to sort by path names. Passing --sort with no value
defaults to sorting by the sort order values in the database.

View
Run: php entry/path.php view path_id

For the given Path, this command displays the name, full path, sort order,
permissions, which Users and Groups have access and which Users and Groups are
denied access.

Permission
Run: php entry/path.php permission (--add|--remove) path_id permission

This command is used to assign or remove permissions (eg. 'gps', 'symlinks',
etc) from a particular Path. See permissions.txt for a detailed overview of all
available permissions.

Allow
Run: php entry/path.php allow (--add|--remove) (--user|--group) path_id [entity_name]

This command is used to allow a User or Group access to view a particular Path.
You must specify whether you are adding or removing the access with --add or
--remove, then specify if you are adding access for a User with --user or a
Group with --group. You must then specify the path ID and then the name of
the entity. If you omit the name of the entity, you will be greeted with an
interactive prompt to enter the name.

Deny
Run: php entry/path.php deny (--add|--remove) (--user|--group) path_id [entity_name]

This command is used to deny a User or Group access to view a particular Path.
You must specify whether you are adding or removing the denial with --add or
--remove, then specify if you are denying access for a User with --user or a
Group with --group. You must then specify the path ID and then the name of
the entity. If you omit the name of the entity, you will be greeted with an
interactive prompt to enter the name.
