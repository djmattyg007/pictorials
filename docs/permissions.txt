Pictorials forces you to opt-in to support for various features on a per-path
basis. These are generally features that could reveal sensitive information,
or be a potential security issue. All of these permissions are listed below.


gps

Enabling the gps permission for a path will add a "Map" button to the carousel
modal when viewing a photo, if there is GPS data embedded within the image.
This functionality is also dependent on supplying your mapbox API key and a
map ID.

metadata

Enabling the metadata permission for a path will add a "Metadata" button to the
carousel modal when viewing a photo, if there is relevant metadata embedded
within the image. Clicking the button will display this metadata. The date the
photo was taken will also be displayed near the button, if that data is
available.

nsfw

By default, Pictorials hides and blocks all access to folders named "NSFW".
Enabling the nsfw permission causes Pictorials to switch off these checks.

symlinks

By default, Pictorials will not follow symlinks. Enabling the symlinks
permission will cause Pictorials to follow symlinks for the given path.
